## Tool Selection Justification
I chose **Replit Agent** because it provides an integrated, browser-based development environment with a built-in AI agent. This made it ideal for quickly building a complete, functional project without dealing with local setup, dependencies, or configuration issues. The conversational and agent-based workflow was especially appealing for experimenting with vibe coding.

## Development Process
I started the project by describing the desired Todo List application in natural language, including features such as adding, editing, deleting tasks, filtering by status, and localStorage persistence. Replit Agent generated the full project structure, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

After the initial generation, I tested the application and iterated by giving additional prompts to fix minor issues and improve usability. Clear, structured prompts worked best, especially when specifying exact features and asking the agent to keep the existing file structure.

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge was ensuring that all features worked correctly together, particularly task editing and data persistence. In some cases, the initial logic needed refinement to keep task counts and filters in sync. Replit Agent helped resolve these issues quickly by updating the logic after feedback.

Another challenge was understanding and reviewing the generated code. While the AI produced working code, I still needed to read through it to ensure correctness and clarity. This reinforced the importance of human oversight even when using advanced AI tools.

## Reflection
What surprised me most was how much of the project could be completed through conversation alone. Vibe coding significantly reduced the time spent on boilerplate and setup, allowing me to focus on functionality and testing.

This experience changed my development workflow by making it more iterative and high-level. I would use Replit Agent again for prototyping, learning, and small-to-medium projects. In the future, vibe coding tools are likely to become standard assistants, helping developers work faster while still requiring critical thinking and review.
